					<h3 style="font-family: 'Quicksand">ASU Dining Hall Selector</h3>
				  	<p style="font-family: 'Quicksand">A web scrapping program built to eliminate the hassle of checking the ASU Dining Hall menus individually to determine the optimal dining hall to eat food of your interest. The program scrapes data from ASU's online dining hall menus and compares each menu item to your liked and disliked foods. Each dining hall is scored based on a points system based on several factors. The dining hall with the most points is suggested to the user. Here is the points guide:</p>
				  	<ul>
						<li style="font-family: 'Quicksand">1 pt if Dining hall is OPEN</li>
						<li style="font-family: 'Quicksand">1 pt for keyword match with LIKES array</li>
						<li style="font-family: 'Quicksand">1 pt for keyword match in description with LIKES array</li>
						<li style="font-family: 'Quicksand">(DISLIKES are omitted entirely from list)</li>
					</ul>
				  	<p style="font-family: 'Quicksand"><br>To make the program more accessible, I have designed it to send a rather well styled email with a summary of the status and items being served at all dining halls. These emails are sent at preprogrammed times which can be changed by the user.<br><br>Click on the text to view the Github repository...</p>

		  			<p style="font-family: 'Quicksand">As a boy scout, to complete eagle, I had to complete an eagle project. After some research, I had found somewhat of a problem. Up to 61% of low-income families do not have any books for their kids at home. I have addressed this eminent problem by making so called “box libraries” as my eagle project. These "box libraries" are boxes placed in people's yards which consists of books that have been donated by the community. These books can be taken and returned at one's will eliminating the hassle of going to a local library. The “box library” will also give book access to those who need it most.<br><br>Funds for this project were raised almost entirely through donations. Books were also collected through book drives that I was able to organize.<br><br>Click the card to view a little free library blog post freaturing this project...<br><br></p>
